# Linux RPG

Linux RPG is a text-based RPG game. It's not overly complex and has no practical use. But, hey! It was fun to make. And it encouraged me to get more engaed in to my Unix college course than I already was. While this wasn't a course assignment, I still enjoy working on this project in my spare time (sdrawkcab si siht ezilaer uoy fi uoy ot sporp dna edur eb ton ot sa ekawa flesym peek ot siht no krow I os wonk ydaerla I gnihtemos tuoba gniklat si rosseforp eht nehw yltsom).

### Usage

The only thing you need to do is set your bash at the top. I'll work on having to where it will find it automatically.

You can find your bash location like so:
```sh
$ which bash
```

If you'd like to run the game, navigate to the folder containing the run file and type:
```sh
$ ./run
```

You may see some errors like so:
```sh
$ ./run: line 9: clear: command not found
```

If you do, it can most likely be ignored. You just don't have the proper command for it. I found that error when running the project in Cygwin and not your typical Linux distribution. If you want to get rid of it, just install the necessary packages and you're good to go.

### Development

Want to contribute? Feel free to. Send me a message and we'll get some collaboration going. This project isn't headed anywhere in particular. I mean... read the features section... Come on. If you want to add some random stuff the project, I'm all for it. So long as it's mature (emotionally).
